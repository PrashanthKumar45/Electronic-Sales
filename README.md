# 📊 Electronic Sales Analysis
🧾 Project Overview

This academic project focuses on analyzing electronic sales data to identify trends, customer behavior, and performance patterns. The goal is to derive actionable insights from the dataset using data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques.

# 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is Electronic Sales.01.xlsx, which contains information about product sales, revenue, and related variables in the electronic retail sector.

Key features may include:

Date – Transaction date

Product – Electronic item name

Category – Product category

Quantity – Number of units sold

Price – Selling price per unit

Revenue – Total sales amount

Region – Sales region or store location

(Feature names may vary depending on the original dataset.)

# 🧠 Project Objectives

Perform data cleaning and handle missing or inconsistent values

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations
